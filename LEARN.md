STEP 1: 

creating a variables like suits,ranks. that are used for making cards and assigning their respecting names to the variables
creating a variable value by assigning a values of dictionary to calculate the total value of the card

STEP 2: 

creating a class Card. usually a card consists of a rank and suits.
creating class Deck(which is built from the instance of card using a for loop), a deck consists of 52 cards
creating class Hand, for adding the cards and the calculating the values of the cards
creating class Chips, which is the bet that the player keeps for playing and it has the properties of winning bet and the losing bet

STEP 3:

creating functions for the tasks that will be repeatedly used in the code like,

taking bet(taking the bet amount from the player)
hit(whether the player want to add one more card)
hit or stand(wheter player want to add one more card or don't want to add a card)
showing some cards(where at the start of the game the player shows booth the cards, but the dealer shows only one card and this is displayed using this function)
showing all cards(at the end of the game both show their booth the cards)

STEP 4:

functions for displaying in the end of the game,

if player wins(they will win their bet)
if player busts or loose(they will loose their bet)
if dealer wins(they will win their bet)
if dealer busts(they will loose their bet)
